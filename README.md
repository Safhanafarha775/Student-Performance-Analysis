# Student-Performance-Analysis
A beginner-friendly **Data Science project** using **Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn** to analyze and visualize student performance across different subjects.


## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates:
- Data Cleaning with Pandas
- Adding calculated fields (Total, Average, Grade)
- Grouping and Aggregation (Gender-wise performance)
- Visualizing data using Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Exporting clean datasets

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python** 🐍
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation
- **Matplotlib** – Visualization
- **Seaborn** – Advanced charts

---

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains marks of students in **Maths, Science, and English** along with their gender.

**Columns:**
- Name
- Gender
- Maths
- Science
- English
- Total (calculated)
- Average (calculated)
- Grade (calculated)
